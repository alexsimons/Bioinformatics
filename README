## Overview

Takes dna Strings from gbk files and places them into a Btree, and then searched.

## Cache Improvements

All Tests ran using test3.gbk sequence length , and query7.

Time without Cache GeneBankCreate:  86.4 seconds.
Time with Cache size 100 GeneBankCreate:  43.4 seconds.
Time with Cache size 500 GeneBankCreate:  26.5 seconds.

Time without Cache GeneBankSearch:  12.6 seconds.
Time without Cache size 100 GeneBankSearch:  12.5 seconds.
Time without Cache size 500 GeneBankSearch:  12.4 seconds.

Cache use is almost twice as fast with GeneBankCreate, and not much different for GeneBankSearch.
